The kickstarters with lower goals were more succesful achieving it as seen on the descriptive statistics sheet.
Recommendation: Set lower goal for startup and have a limited time for the campaign. 
### Challenge
The percentage of success of a kickstarter is the higher when the goal amount is lower. 
When the goal is high the likelyhood of a kickstarter project failing and getting cancelled are high.
The best times to launch a kickstarter project is between the months of April to June.
