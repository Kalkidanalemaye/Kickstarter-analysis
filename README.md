# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

#### Steps taken for analysis

-From a dataset with kickstarter campaigns, I performed data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends.
-To start with the analysis, create two excel sheets showing results based on launch date and goals of each campaigns.

The kickstarters with lower goals were more succesful achieving it as seen on the descriptive statistics sheet.
Recommendation: Set lower goal for startup and have a limited time for the campaign. 
### Challenge
The percentage of success of a kickstarter is the higher when the goal amount is lower. 
When the goal is high the likelyhood of a kickstarter project failing and getting cancelled are high.
The best times to launch a kickstarter project is between the months of April to June.
